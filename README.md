# Random Walk

A program that generates a random walk across a 10x10 array. Initially, the array will contain only dot characters (‘.’). The program must randomly “walk” from element to element, always going up, down, left, or right by one step. The elements visited by the program will be labeled with the letters A through Z, in the order visited.
